# Python Helper

Python has its own package manager - pip (Pip Installs Packages). One of the things pip does poorly is installing updates for all pip installed packages.

* Write a script, any language, that upgrades all installed pip packages.
* (Optional) pip complains if it is not the most up-to-date. Update pip first.
* (Optional) List out all the packages updated.
* (Optional) Handle errors gracefully.
* (Optional) Any other features you find desirable.

This script is for you, as you migrate your python environment to the Pi. It has to be useful to you. This means understanding how the script works, as you have to maintain it, the output, as you have to look at it.
